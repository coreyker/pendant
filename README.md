### Description
Pendant is a simple python package for training and inference using (deep) artificial neural networks.  This package was created for research and pedagogical purposes with musical data in mind (1d time-series data), however, many other good packges exist [1-3].

Currently supported models include restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), and deep neural networks (DNN).

### Installation
Download/clone the repository and add its location to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.  See the test scripts in each model file for example use-cases.
